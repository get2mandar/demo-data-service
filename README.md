Demo Project for Spring Boot Data Test with H2 SB 2.5.0

While Working on one of the sample Projects, I observed that Multi-Row and Multiline insert from the data SQL file, within the Project is failing to load and the Applicaiton was not able to start. I investigated and created this sample project to explain the working code for the issue.

Also the same has been reported in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67650704/spring-boot-2-5-0-spring-cloud-2020-0-2-and-hibernate-5-4-31-h2-database-mult), from there more details can be collected for the issue.

This Sample project can be downloaded to verify and confirm the reported issue.
